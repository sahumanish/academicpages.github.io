excerpt: 'Surgical  tool  segmentation  in  endoscopic  videos  is  an  im-portant component of computer assisted interventions systems. Recentsuccess of image-based solutions using fully-supervised deep learning ap-proaches can be attributed to the collection of big labeled datasets. How-ever, the annotation of a big dataset of real videos can be prohibitivelyexpensive and time consuming. Computer simulations could alleviate themanual  labeling  problem,  however,  models  trained  on  simulated  datado not generalize to real data. This work proposes a consistency-basedframework for joint learning of simulated and real (unlabeled) endoscopicdata to bridge this performance generalization issue. Empirical resultson  two  data  sets  (15  videos  of  the  Cholec80  and  EndoVis’15  dataset)highlight  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposedEndo-Sim2Realmethod  forinstrument segmentation. We compare the segmentation of the proposedapproach with state-of-the-art solutions and show that our method im-proves segmentation both in terms of quality and quantity.'
